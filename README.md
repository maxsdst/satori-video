## Project Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application built with **React**, which communicates with the backend through a **REST API**. The backend is implemented using **Django**, and **PostgreSQL** is used for data storage. **AWS S3** serves as the file storage.

Background tasks, such as video processing, are managed with **Celery** and a **Redis** message broker. **FFmpeg** handles video processing, and videos are served from **AWS S3** using the **HLS streaming protocol** for smooth playback.

Personalized video recommendations are powered by **[Gorse](https://github.com/gorse-io/gorse)**, which employs collaborative filtering to suggest videos based on user preferences. User actions such as likes, saves, and shares are treated as positive feedback, influencing their personalized recommendations. Additionally, Gorse provides popular and latest video suggestions.

Video search functionality is implemented with **PostgreSQL Full Text Search**, allowing users to find videos by title and description, sorted by relevance.
